# Covid Data Analysis

To familiarize myself with data analysis, I worked on a Data Analyst Portfolio Project during the summer of 2022. I made a Covid Dashboard using the data from 2020-2021 extracted from ourworldindata webpage. It was a good experience practicing with Excel, SQL, and tableau for data processing, cleaning, and visualization. It helped me practice programming skills I learned from taking online classes from Coursera and Udemy. The dashboard contains information about the total covid cases around the world and a map that shows the percent of population infected, and a line chart showing the top five countries with the most percentage of their population infected. All of this is done using SQL queries and data extracted from excel.
