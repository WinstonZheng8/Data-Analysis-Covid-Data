In the summer of 2022, I developed an interactive COVID-19 dashboard to visualize the global impact of the pandemic from 2020 to 2021. 

The objective of the project was to aggregate and present key statistics related to COVID-19 cases and deaths using data extracted from the Our World in Data repository via Excel and SQL.

Using Tableau, I designed a comprehensive dashboard featuring:
- Global metrics, including total COVID-19 cases (over 150 million), total deaths (over 3.1 million), and the global death percentage (2.11%).


- A world map showing the percent of the population infected per country, with a color gradient highlighting the severity of spread (ranging from 0% to over 17%).


- A bar chart comparing total deaths by continent, revealing that Europe and North America had the highest death tolls, followed by South America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania.


- A time-series line chart tracking the average percentage of population infected from January 2020 to April 2021 in the top five countries (United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, India, and China), showing a steep rise starting mid-2020.


All data cleaning and extraction were performed using SQL queries within Excel, and I applied skills I gained from Udemy and Coursera courses in both Excel and SQL. 
This project improved my data visualization and storytelling skills while reinforcing my knowledge of data integration and dashboard design for real-world public health monitoring.
